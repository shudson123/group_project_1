Project 1: Create your first app!

Description
Alimentum is an app made for people to search for meals and learn about each meal’s nutrition value. Alimentum can be used by all, but built with the demographic of intermediate to advanced cooks who are cooking to impress. Because of that, users search by meal instead of ingredients. With advanced cooks in mind, nutrition is important which is why we choose to display that information for each meal. This allows each user to learn more about their meal if they have diet restrictions or have a specific health lifestyle.

Motivation
We wanted to make an app that would be easy for someone to track their nutrient intake with each meal. We wanted people to become more aware of what nutrients they are intaking as well as missing in their body.

Results
An app to search for meals with its nutrient content listed.

Team Efforts/Individual Responsibilities
After brainstorming ideas and APIs together, a landing page was first created before splitting up the work. From there, Emerson worked on the meal/recipe API to function and created the corresponding table. Sean worked on the nutrients API and corresponding table/modal for that. Pamela worked on storing the data into Firebase and populating it into ‘My Collections’. Design was a collaborative effort which Emerson took the lead. 

APIs Used
- Meal Database API
- NutrionIX API

Techonologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Modernizr, Firebase DB

Challenges
- Because there are many ways to do one thing, it was challenging to decide on the final solution for any one problem whether it was the design, functionality of the app, etc. 
-  pushing and pulling updates from GitHub using the command line

Improvements
Changes we would make going forward would be:
- Search first by nutrient to find recipe
- List restaurants with similar meal or culinary as a bonus
- Add user authentication
